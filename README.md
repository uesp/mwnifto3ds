# mwnifto3ds
A very old utility used to convert Morrowind NIF model files to 3DS files. Contact Dave Humphrey (dave@uesp.net) for more information.

This is the original code import and hasn't been modified to compile in modern Visual Studio.
It probably requires the UESP mw-common repository to compile.
